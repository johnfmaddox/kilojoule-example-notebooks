    "Simply arriving at the correct answer for a problem is only half the battle.  You then need to be able to communicate your methods and results to a range of audiences (in this class your instructor).  This should be done following technical writing conventions with a narrative discussion of your process including properly formatted equations and sample calculations.  It is not sufficient to simply submit your code and a final numerical answer or a long list of equations without any explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout your academic career you have learned many different conventions (shorthand) for writing down mathematical concepts, i.e. to show a variable is being raised to a power we put that power in the superscript $x^2$.  However, there is no key on your keyboard to make that 2 shrink in size and move above the variable.  You'll also notice that the $x$ was not written in the same font as the rest of the text.  It is convention for variables to be written in italics rather than normal font because it helps the reader quickly distinguish them from regular text (you probably already do this in your head without realizing it).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways to create properly formatted equations.  While the Microsoft equation editor has improved greatly in recent years, the most powerful tool is the formatting language $\\LaTeX$.  $\\LaTeX$ has been around for many decades and it was developed to represent complex mathematical expressions using plain text (just the keys on a regular keyboard).  While there is a bit of a learning curve if you choose to start using $\\LaTeX$, your efforts will pay off many times over as you will find that most scientific/mathematical software has $\\LaTeX$ support built in.  In fact, learning $\\LaTeX$ will even make you faster when you do need to use Microsoft Equation editor (in Word or PowerPoint) because it includes support for many $\\LaTeX$ symbol names.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter notebook this document is being created in has built-in $\\LaTeX$ support.  In some of the earlier examples you may have noticed special symbols in some of the output, such as $\\Delta^\\circ\\text{C}$.  Those were created using $\\LaTeX$ formatting and the special symbols in this explanation were also created using $\\LaTeX$ formatting (if you are reading this in a live notebook, double-click on this cell to see the source code written in Markdown syntax).  You can include inline math, $f(x)=5x^2-3x+2$, or you can include \"display\" math \n",
    "$$f(x) = \\int_0^\\infty\\frac{3}{2}x\\ dx$$\n",

    "To help you convert your calculations into technical writing format, the `kilojoule` library provides a few convenience functions in its `display` module to automate the $\\LaTeX$ creation process.  The `%%showcalc` iPython magic command will trigger a process that attempts to convert the code in the current cell to $\\LaTeX$ and show the progression of the calculations from symbolic to final numerical form.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the use of `%%showcalc` we'll step through the evaluation and display of the function $\\psi=ax-cx^2+\\frac{b}{x}$.  We'll start by defining values for `a`, `b`, and `x`\n",
