    "# kiloJoule Library\n",
    "`kilojoule` is a python library to simplify for use in thermal/fluid calculations.  The main advantage to this approach is the nomenclature for the functions you will be using in Python will be consistent with the nomenclature from your textbook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to using this library, it needs to be installed to a location where the Python interpreter can find it.  If you are using CoClac, this will have already been done for you.  If you are using a local installation of Python you can install the library from the Python Package Index (PyPi) using the command \n",
