    "# kiloJoule Library\n",
    "We will be using a custom python library, `kilojoule`, written for use in thermal/fluid calculations.  The main advantage to this approach is the nomenclature for the functions you will be using in Python will be consistent with the nomenclature from your textbook.  The disadvantage to this approach is there will be limited sources for external tech support (you won't find example code using this library outside of this course).\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to using this library, it needs to be installed to a location where the Python interpreter can find it.  If you are using CoClac, this will have already been done for you.  If you are using a local installation of Python you can install the library from the Python Package Index (PyPi) using the command \n",
    "\n",
    "\tpip install kilojoule\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the version available through `pip` may not be as up to date as the git version.  To install the most recent table release from git:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tpip install git+http://github.com/johnfmaddox/kilojoule.git\n",
    "\n",
    "or to install the development version:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tpip install git+http://github.com/johnfmaddox/kilojoule.git@devel\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing the library, you will need to import it into each notebook where you intend to use it.  If you are referring back to this document and want a quick import template for starting a new file, you can use the following code. "
