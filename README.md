# kiloJoule Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the capabilities of the `kilojoule` library. 

The goal of the `kilojoule` library is to improve the user experience while performing common engineering calculations in python. This is primarily achieved through simplified syntax (reduced typing) and improved output formatting (easier to read).

You can try out it out yourself by clicking one of the following links to lauch a live, intractive environment in your browser through Binder.

* Current Stable Release: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/johnfmaddox/kilojoule-binder/HEAD?urlpath=git-pull?repo=https://github.com/johnfmaddox/kilojoule-notebooks?labpath=Start+Here.ipynb)

* Current Development Release: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/johnfmaddox/kilojoule-binder/devel?urlpath=git-pull?repo=https://github.com/johnfmaddox/kilojoule-example-notebooks?labpath=Start+Here.ipynb)

The Binder environment will reset each time you close it, so you will need to download any changes you want to keep. If you find this library useful, you can install it from the [Python Package Index (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/project/kilojoule/)

> pip install kilojoule

or you can install the development version from [Github: github.com/johnfmaddox/kilojoule](https://github.com/johnfmaddox/kilojoule)

> pip install git+http://github.com/johnfmaddox/kilojoule.git@devel

`kilojoule` is free and open source software and is release under the MIT license. You are encouraged to contribute to it's ongoing development.
