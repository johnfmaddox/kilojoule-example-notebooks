    "Steam at a pressure of $14\\,\\mathrm{bar}$ and a temperature of $300^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ is flowing in a pipe.  Connected to the pipe through a valve is an initially evacuated tank with a volume of $0.25\\,\\mathrm{m^3}$.  The tank fills with steam until mechanical equilibrium is achieved.  Assume the system is adiabatic and that changes in kinetic and potential energy are negligible.  What is the final temperature in the tank, and how much entropy was generated during the process?"

    "The example code above used just the standard python library to complete our calculations.

However, there are a few weakness in this approach.  \n",

Specifically, each time we pulled properties from the tables (directly or through interpolation) we typed the numbers from the tables into our code.  If the operating conditions changed, we would need to go through and update each of those numbers by hand **(23 place in this relatively simple example)**.  It would be much better if we could automate that process by using a function to look up the properties for us.  \n",

    "A second weakness is that we didn't include units in our calculations.  Most (if not all) of the numbers we will be using in our calculations for this course represent physical quantities, which have no real significance without their units.  In the example above, we have made comments beside many of the operations to reminds us of the units and we printed the units in the output for our answers.  However, this method requires us to do the unit tracking and unit conversion outside of the calculations, which can lead to unit errors and inconsistency.  It would be better if the unit tracking and conversion were an integral part of our calculations.\n",

    "In the second version of the example, you can see that there are **only three hard coded numbers**: the inlet temperature (`T['i']`), the inlet pressure (`p['i']`), and the tank volume (`V`).  This is a major improvement over the first iteration of the code because we can simply change the three lines in the `# Given Parameters` section to re-run our calculations for different operating conditions, a different unit system (i.e. English units), or even a different fluid (assuming we select one of the fluids supported by the `CoolProp` library).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also notice that the units were an integral part of the calculation.  All the functions in the `kilojoule` library support (and require) dimensional units for all physical quantities.  Besides being a good practice to use for all engineering calculations, this has the added benefit that the unit conversions are handled automatically; we did not need to convert 14 bar to 1400 kPa manually, and we did not need to specify the output units for each of the calculated parameters.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the `kilojoule` package provides the `%%showcalc` cell magic command and the `Summary()` class that take advantage of the $\\LaTeX$ capability built into to the Jupyter notebook to display the results of the calculations in nicely formatted equations that appear the way you would write them by hand.  The progression for each calculation from symbolic form to expanded numeric form to final solution allows the reader to see the details of your work quickly, and this is also the form you should use to show your work whenever you are submitting handwritten solutions for homework or on exams to be eligible for partial credit.
